    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write a Python program where the computer asks you to input three different numbers. After you provide the numbers, the computer will ask you to specify which number you would like to retrieve by inputting a position (1 for the first number, 2 for the second, or 3 for the third). The program will then output the corresponding number.\n",

    "### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The program must ask for **three numbers** from the user.\n",
    "2. The user should input a **position (1, 2, or 3)**, and the program should output the number at that position.\n",
    "3. The program should handle the selection of the number using list indexing. Remember that list indexing starts from 0, so you need to adjust for this.\n",
    "4. Include **comments** to explain the logic in the code for clarity.\n",
