    "## 1. Area of a Triangle\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write a Python program to calculate the area of a triangle when given the lengths of its three sides. You will use Heron's formula to compute the area based on the side lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heron's formula states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Area} = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.\n",
    "- \\(s\\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The program must prompt the user to input three positive numbers representing the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n",
    "2. The program should calculate the semi-perimeter \\(s\\) and use it to compute the area of the triangle using Heron's formula.\n",
    "4. Use **comments** to explain the steps in the program for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input\n",
    "```ascii\n",
    "Enter the length of side 1: 3\n",
    "Enter the length of side 2: 4\n",
    "Enter the length of side 3: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Output\n",
    "```ascii\n",
    "The area of the triangle is 6.00.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint\n",
    "You can use the expression `** (1/2)` to calculate the square root of a number in Python.\n"

    "## 2. Sorting Heights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write a Python program where the computer asks the user to input the heights of 5 people. The program will then sort the heights in ascending order and display them in a formatted output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a **for loop** to prompt the user for the heights of 5 people.\n",
    "2. For each person, the computer should ask, \"What's the height of person `<number>`?\" where `<number>` is the personâ€™s number (from 1 to 5).\n",
    "3. After collecting all the heights, the program should sort the list in ascending order and output the sorted heights.\n",
    "4. Include **comments** in your code to explain each step for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input\n",
    "```ascii\n",
    "What's the height of person 1? 160\n",
    "What's the height of person 2? 170\n",
    "What's the height of person 3? 180\n",
    "What's the height of person 4? 165\n",
    "What's the height of person 5? 175\n",

    "### Sample Output\n",
    "```ascii\n",
    "Sorted heights: 160, 165, 170, 175, 180\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **List Initialization**: Start with an empty list to store the heights.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    heights = []\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. **Repeat 5 times**: Use a `for` loop to ask the user for the height of 5 people. After each input, store the height in the list using `list.append()`."

    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write a Python program that starts with an empty list of cats and then performs a series of operations. You will append new cats to the list, remove bad cats from the list, and finally sort the remaining cats by their tag number. This time, there will be more cats to manage, so the task can only be efficiently solved using a loop.\n",
