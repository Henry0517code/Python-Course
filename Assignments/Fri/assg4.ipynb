    "## 1. Officer Meow: Cat Patrol 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Officer Meow is back on patrol! This time, the task is to manage a list of cats by identifying and removing bad cats within a specified range. You will start with an empty list, add a series of new cats, and then identify which cats are \"bad\" based on user-specified start and end positions in the list. Finally, you will remove these bad cats from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to write a Python program that performs these operations using slicing to identify the bad cats and a loop to remove them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with an empty list of cats.\n",
    "2. Append a given list of new cats to the `cats` list.\n",
    "3. Ask the user to enter the start and end positions of the bad cats range.\n",
    "4. Use the slice operator to identify the bad cats within this range and remove them from the `cats` list.\n",
    "5. Print the updated list of cats after removing the bad cats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Start with an empty list of cats\n",
    "cats = []\n",
    "\n",
    "# List of new cats to be added\n",
    "new_cats = ['cat #10', 'cat #3', 'cat #12', 'cat #8', 'cat #15', 'cat #5', 'cat #1']\n",

    "\n",

    "2\n",
    "Where's the end of the bad cats?\n",

    "\n",
    "Doctor Meow Meow, the famed feline health inspector, is on a mission to check the health of 30 townsfolk by calculating their Body Mass Index (BMI). Each townsperson's BMI needs to be calculated and assessed to identify who might need a bit more exercise... or maybe just a nice nap.\n",

    "\n",
    "BMI is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight (kg)}}{\\left(\\text{height (m)}\\right)^2}\n",
    "$\n",

    "\n",

    "2. Identify and print the names of the person with the smallest and largest BMI.\n",
