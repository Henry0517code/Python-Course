    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with designing a program to classify a year as either a **leap year** or a **common year**. A leap year is a year that satisfies the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 **and**:\n",
    "   - Not divisible by 100, **or**\n",
    "   - Divisible by 400.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Examples:\n",
    "   - 2024 is a leap year (divisible by 4, not by 100)\n",
    "   - 2000 was a leap year (divisible by 400)\n",
    "   - 2100 will not be a leap year (divisible by 100, not by 400)\n",
    "   - 2023 is not a leap year (not divisible by 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the year is a common year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should:\n",
    "1. Ask the user to input a year.\n",
    "2. Use conditional statements to determine whether the year is a leap year or a common year.\n",
    "3. Print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use **input()** to get a year from the user.\n",
    "2. Use conditional statements to check for the leap year conditions.\n",
    "3. Print either `\"Leap Year\"` or `\"Common Year\"` based on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input and Output\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input:\n",
    "```ascii\n",
    "Enter a year: 2020\n",
    "```\n",
