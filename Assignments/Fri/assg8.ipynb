    "## 1. Library Book Lookup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with designing a simple **Library Book Lookup** system. The library keeps track of its books using a dictionary, where the book title is the key, and the value is the book's availability status (`\"Available\"` or `\"Checked Out\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should:\n",
    "1. Allow the user to input a book title they want to look up.\n",
    "2. Use the `.get()` method to check if the book exists in the library.\n",
    "3. If the book exists, display its availability status.\n",
    "4. If the book doesn’t exist, inform the user that the book is not in the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Library Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "library = {\n",
    "    \"The Great Gatsby\": \"Available\",\n",
    "    \"To Kill a Mockingbird\": \"Checked Out\",\n",
    "    \"1984\": \"Available\",\n",
    "    \"Moby Dick\": \"Checked Out\",\n",
    "    \"Pride and Prejudice\": \"Available\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the book exists, print its availability status.\n",
    "2. If the book doesn’t exist, return a default message like `\"Sorry, this book is not in our library.\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "```ascii\n",
    "Which book are you looking for? 1984\n",
    "1984 is Available.\n",

    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with designing a program to manage data about a **space exploration project**. The program tracks multiple planets, each with several missions. Each mission has specific details such as the year it started, the spacecraft used, and its success status.\n",

    "The data is stored in a **nested dictionary**, structured as:\n",
    "- **Planet name** → **Mission name** → **Mission details (year, spacecraft, success)**\n",

    "Your program will allow users to:\n",

    "    }\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **View Successful Missions**:\n",
    "   - Display all missions where the `success` field is `True`, along with their details (year and spacecraft).\n",
    "2. **Use For Loop**:\n",
