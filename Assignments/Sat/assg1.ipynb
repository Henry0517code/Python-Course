    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write a Python program where the computer prompts you with a series of questions about yourself. After answering the questions, the program will output a summary of your responses in a friendly format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The questions the program should ask include:\n",
    "1. What’s your name?\n",
    "2. How old are you?\n",
    "3. What’s your favorite hobby?\n",
    "4. What’s your favorite programming language?\n",

    "### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The program must display the self-introduction using a **formatted string**, exactly as shown in the sample output.\n",
