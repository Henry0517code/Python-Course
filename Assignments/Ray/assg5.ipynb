    "\n",
    "Your friends are planning an **Ice-Cream Party**, and everyone has their favorite flavors.\n",
    "Write a small program that recommends the **most popular flavor** so the host knows which tub to buy in bulk.\n",

    "2. **`most_popular(flavor_counts)`**\n",
    "   *Input:* the dictionary returned by `count_flavors`\n",
    "   *Output:* the single flavor that has the highest count (break ties however you wish).\n",

    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Store the data in a **dictionary of lists** where keys are friend names and values are their favorite flavors.\n",
    "2. Implement and call **both functions** described above.\n",
    "3. Use a **for loop** inside `count_flavors` to tally mentions.\n",

    "   Either\n",
