    "## 1. Officer Meow: Cat Patrol\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write a Python program that starts with an empty list of cats and then performs a series of operations. You will append new cats to the list, remove bad cats from the list, and finally sort the remaining cats by their tag number. This time, there will be more cats to manage, so the task can only be efficiently solved using a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Append**: Start with an empty list of cats and append a list of new cats.\n",
    "2. **Remove**: Remove all the bad cats from the list based on a given list of bad cats.\n",
    "3. **Sort**: Sort the remaining cats by their tag number in ascending order.\n",
    "4. **For Loop**: Use a `for` loop to handle the appending and removing operations, as there will be more cats to deal with!\n",
    "\n",
    "The program must print the updated list after each operation to show the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Start with an empty list of cats\n",
    "cats = []\n",
    "\n",
    "# List of new cats to be added\n",
    "new_cats = ['cat #10', 'cat #3', 'cat #12', 'cat #8', 'cat #15', 'cat #5', 'cat #1']\n",
    "\n",
    "# List of bad cats to be removed\n",
    "bad_cats = ['cat #12', 'cat #5', 'cat #10']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Output\n",
    "\n",
    "```ascii\n",
    "After appending new cats: ['cat #10', 'cat #3', 'cat #12', 'cat #8', 'cat #15', 'cat #5', 'cat #1']\n",

    "## 2. Doctor Meow Meow: The Feline Health Inspector\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctor Meow Meow, the famed feline health inspector, is on a mission to check the health of 30 townsfolk by calculating their Body Mass Index (BMI). Each townsperson's BMI needs to be calculated and assessed to identify who might need a bit more exercise... or maybe just a nice nap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to help Doctor Meow Meow analyze the data. Given a list of names, heights, and weights, calculate the BMI for each person, print it out, and finally, reveal who has the smallest and largest BMI in town.\n",
    "\n",
    "BMI is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight (kg)}}{\\left(\\text{height (m)}\\right)^2}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a `for` loop with `range` to iterate over each person’s information and calculate their BMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identify and print the names of the person with the smallest and largest BMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input\n",

    "\n",
    "- You may use `list.index()` to retrieve the name associated with the min/max BMI.\n",
    "- Example: `[22.5, 24.3, 19.8].index(19.8)` will return `2`, which you can use to access the correct name from the `names` list."
