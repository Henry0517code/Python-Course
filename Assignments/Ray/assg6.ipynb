    "## üé® 1. Magic Painting Contest: Advanced Round\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are building an **Magic Painting Contest** system. Each contestant paints with a set of **colors** and optionally applies **special effects**. The more **vibrant** the colors and the more **creative** the effects, the higher the painting score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to write a function `create_painting(name, *colors, **effects)` that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prints the artist's name.\n",
    "2. Validates and reports how many **valid colors** are used.\n",
    "3. Prints and scores each **special effect** based on custom rules.\n",
    "4. Outputs a **total creativity score** for the painting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Color Rules**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Only count the following as valid colors: `\"red\"`, `\"blue\"`, `\"green\"`, `\"yellow\"`, `\"purple\"`, `\"orange\"`, `\"black\"`, `\"white\"`.\n",
    "  * Ignore invalid or unknown colors.\n",
    "  * Each valid color contributes **5 points** to the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Effect Scoring (examples)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  | Effect   | Score                                 |\n",
    "  | -------- | ------------------------------------- |\n",
    "  | sparkles | 10 if True                            |\n",
    "  | glow     | \"low\" ‚Üí 5, \"medium\" ‚Üí 10, \"high\" ‚Üí 15 |\n",
    "  | shadow   | 7 if True                             |\n",
    "  | glitter  | 5 if True                             |\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Any unknown effect contributes **0 points**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `*args` for colors, `**kwargs` for effects.\n",
    "2. Use **loops** and **conditionals** to validate and score entries.\n",
    "3. Use `.get()` for effect scoring (with default score of 0).\n",
    "4. At the end, **print the final creativity score**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Function Call\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "create_painting(\n",
    "    \"Luna\",\n",
    "    \"red\", \"silver\", \"blue\", \"sparkly green\", \"black\",\n",
    "    sparkles=True,\n",
    "    glow=\"medium\",\n",
    "    shadow=True,\n",
    "    glitter=False\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Output\n",
    "\n",
    "```ascii\n",
    "üé® Luna is painting a masterpiece!\n",
    "Valid colors used: red, blue, black\n",
    "Colors score: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "Special effects applied:\n",
    "- sparkles: +10\n",
    "- glow (medium): +10\n",
    "- shadow: +7\n",
    "- glitter: +0\n",

    "### üó°Ô∏è Context\n",
    "\n",
    "You‚Äôve built a modular turn-based combat system in Python that supports attacking, healing, and status effects like stun. Now it‚Äôs time to **level up** the design by adding **three new features**, while maintaining a modular structure (one feature per module).\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß™ Task: Implement These 2 New Features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Let the Player Decide**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the existing logic so that instead of two computer-controlled entities fighting, **you (the user)** play as one of the characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One player is **you** (the human), the other is the **computer** (random choices).\n",
    "* In each of your turns:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The game displays the current HP and status of both players.\n",
    "  * You are given a list of choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    What would you like to do?\n",
    "    1. Attack\n",
    "    2. Heal\n",
    "    3. Shield\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Based on your input (e.g. `1`, `2`, etc.), the appropriate action is executed.\n",
    "* For the **computer**, use `random.choice()` to choose among available actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Shield Mechanic**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a new module called `shield.py`.\n",
    "* Add a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def cast_shield(caster):\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* When used:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Set `caster[\"shield\"] = True` (active for one turn).\n",
    "* Update `attack.py` so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If the target has `\"shield\" == True`, the incoming damage is halved (rounded down).\n",
    "  * After the shield absorbs a hit, it is removed (`target[\"shield\"] = False`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå Reminder: Keep It Modular\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add new modules for each feature.\n",
    "* Only call logic from `main.py`, do not mix implementation into `main.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you'd like a starter template for the player input loop or computer AI turn!\n"
