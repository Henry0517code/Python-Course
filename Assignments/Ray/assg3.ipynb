    "## 1. Grocery Store Checkout\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with designing a simple grocery store checkout system. Each item in the store has a name, price, and stock quantity. Customers will input the items they want to buy along with the quantities, and the program will calculate the total cost of their purchase. \n",
    "\n",
    "The customer can only purchase up to **three items** in one transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The store's inventory is given in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Item    | Price ($) | Stock |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|-------|\n",
    "| Apple   | 2         | 10    |\n",
    "| Banana  | 1         | 5     |\n",
    "| Orange  | 3         | 8     |\n",
    "| Grape   | 4         | 3     |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create two dictionaries, one for prices and one for stocks, based on the table above.\n",
    "2. Ask the customer for three items they want to purchase and the quantities, one at a time.\n",
    "3. Check if the requested quantity is available:\n",
    "   - If enough stock is available, calculate the cost and deduct the stock.\n",
    "   - If not, inform the customer that the item is out of stock or the quantity is insufficient.\n",
    "4. Display the total cost of the purchase at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input\n",
    "\n",
    "```ascii\n",
    "What do you want to buy? apple\n",
    "How many apples do you want? 3\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you want to buy? banana\n",
    "How many bananas do you want? 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you want to buy? orange\n",
    "How many oranges do you want? 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Output\n",
    "\n",
    "```ascii\n",
    "You bought 3 apples for $6.\n",
    "Sorry, we don't have enough bananas. Only 5 left.\n",
    "You bought 2 oranges for $6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total cost: $12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use dictionary indexing to access the price and stock of the requested item:\n",
    "   - Example: `prices[\"apple\"]` gets the price of an apple, and `stocks[\"apple\"]` gets the stock.\n",
    "2. Check stock availability using an `if` statement. For example: `if stocks[item] < asked_quantity:`.\n",
    "3. Keep a running total for the cost of all purchased items and print it at the end.\n",
    "4. Remember to subtract the stock of the purchased item from the inventory with `stocks[item] = stocks[item] - asked_quantity`."

    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with designing a simple **Library Book Lookup** system. The library keeps track of its books using a dictionary, where the book title is the key, and the value is the book's availability status (`\"Available\"` or `\"Checked Out\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should:\n",
    "1. Allow the user to input a book title they want to look up.\n",
    "2. Use the `.get()` method to check if the book exists in the library.\n",
    "3. If the book exists, display its availability status.\n",
    "4. If the book doesn’t exist, inform the user that the book is not in the library.\n",
