## Course Format

1. **Course Delivery**: The course will be conducted through **Google Meet**. 
2. **Learning Materials**: We’ll dive into key concepts using a textbook, and you’ll get plenty of hands-on coding practice using **Jupyter Notebooks**. 
3. **Exercises**: At the end of each class, you’ll have a fun **exercise** to help you review and wrap up the day’s learning.
4. **Assignments**: After class, you’ll receive **1 to 3 Problems** to work on. These can be submitted through [**Google Drive**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r-KcMK5K-gwQklVu7e33sAiFOadtNBLD?usp=sharing).
5. **Review**: We’ll go over the assignments together at the **beginning of the next class**, so you can ask questions and make sure everything makes sense.
6. **Markdown Usage**: You’ll get a quick intro to **Markdown** during our coding sessions. It’s a handy tool to keep your notes and assignments organized—and a fun way to make your work look professional.
7. **Supplementary Materials**: We’ll share some optional extra readings and resources after each class, found below the course schedule. Feel free to explore them if you want to dive deeper, but only if you're feeling curious—no pressure!
