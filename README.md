## 1. Introduction to Python and Basic Syntax (1-2 hours)
- Introduction to Python: What is a programming language, and the basic features of Python
- Output text and simple calculations
- `print()` function
- Mathematical operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Variables and data types
- Integers, floating-point numbers, strings
- Usage of `input`
- Using `input` for both numbers and text

### Exercises:
1. Use the `print()` function to print your name
2. Solve simple mathematical problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
3. Input a string and display the subsequent data

## 2. If Statements (2-3 hours)

- Understanding conditional statements: `if`, `else`, and `elif`
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Boolean values: `True` and `False`
- Simple conditional statement examples
- Use `if` to explain program flow and differences

### Exercises:
1. Input a number and check if it's greater than 10
2. Input a string and check if it's correct
3. Color psychology test
4. What is AtcCoder? Practice with level A problems

## 3. While Loops (1-2 hours)

- Understanding loops: What are loops, and what is their purpose
- Structure of a while loop
- Loop conditions and termination conditions
- Usage of `break` and `continue`
- Combine `%`, `if`, and `while` for practical applications

### Exercises:
1. Modify the if-statement task to allow continuous input for the psychology test
2. Find out which numbers in a certain range are even, odd, or prime

## 4. For Loops (3-6 hours)

- Introduction to for loops
- How to execute a program over a range (using `range()` and `list`)
- Concepts of lists and count
- Nested loops
- Differences in using for loops with text and numbers
- Combine for loops with random number generation to create games
- Mix the above tools to write programs

### Exercises:
1. Use a for loop to list numbers from 1 to 10
2. 99 multiplication table
3. Pyramid pattern exercise
4. Prime number check
5. Rock-paper-scissors, number guessing game

## 5. Functions (2-4 hours)

- Defining and calling functions: `def` keyword
- Function parameters and return values
- Why use functions

### Exercises:
1. Define a function to print "Hello, Python!"
2. Define a function to calculate the area
3. Advanced exercises for older students: factorial, Fibonacci sequence

## 6. Lists (2-3 hours)

- Understanding lists: What are lists, and what is their purpose
- Basic list operations: add, remove, modify
- Iterating through lists

### Exercises:
1. Store the data from previous programs in a list
2. Perform sorting or calculations on this data

## 7. Comprehensive Exercises (7-10 hours)

- Apply the knowledge learned to create simple games, program applications, practice AtcCoder problems, or tackle high school programming website exercises.
